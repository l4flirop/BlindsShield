Blinds Shield (c) 2015 Michael Barnathan

This is the SmartThings device type for the hacked Blinds.com Economy Motorized Cellular Shade.
It implements a dimmer-like interface, with an "on"/100% status when the shades are fully down,
and an "off"/0% status when the shades are fully up.

To use:

Pair the SmartThings Shield with SmartThings. Go into the SmartThings IDE, create a new SmartApp "from code", and paste the contents of blinds-shield.groovy into the editor. Save and publish for yourself.
Next, navigate to the device corresponding to the shield you've just paired. Edit this device and set the device type to "Blinds Shield". Update the device and refresh SmartThings.

That's it for the server side! Check out the README in the Sketch directory for how to prepare the Arduino and remote.
