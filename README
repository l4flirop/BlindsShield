This is a SmartThings Device Type and Arduino Sketch which will enable you to control a
single Blinds.com Economy Motorized Cellular Shade by modifying the remote control that
ships with it. Contributions to extend support to multiple shades are welcome.

To automate your blinds, you'll need to install the SmartThings device type,
make some modifications to the remote, and load the Arduino sketch. These steps can be
performed in any order, but note the locations of pins 9, 10, 11, 3.3v, and a GND pin on
the Arduino prior to installing the SmartThings Sheild - it's quite difficult to see where the pins are underneath it!

For hardware installation instructions, see the README in the "Sketch" directory.
For SmartApp installation instructions, see the README in the "SmartApp" directory.

Happy hacking!
